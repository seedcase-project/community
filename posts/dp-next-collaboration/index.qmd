    The Novo Nordisk Foundation's annual Steno National Collaborative Grant for 2024
    was awarded to Steno Aarhus for a project called DP-Next. We at Seedcase will
    be collaborating with them on their data infrastructure, engineering, and the (technical)
    training aspects of the project.

Novo Nordisk Foundation has a series of grants aimed at encouraging
collaboration across [Steno](https://steno.dk/) centers called [Steno
National Collaborative
Grant](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/grant/steno-national-collaborative-grant/).
Last year, the [grant](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/grant-recipient/)
was awarded to a project titled *Sustainable Type 2 Diabetes Prevention
for the 21st Century* ([DP-Next](https://dp-next.github.io)), lead by
[Daniel Witte](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/kontakt/daniel-R-witte/) at
Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, where I am the lead on part of [Work
Package 1](https://dp-next.github.io/wp1-ros).

This is the summary of the project:

> "DP-Next is a project aimed at developing a sustainably effective
> strategy for prevention of Type 2 Diabetes [â€¦] We call it DP-Next
> because we intend to develop the next generation of Diabetes
> Prevention strategies.
>
> We aim to use \[modern or underutilised methods and resources\] to
> design and deliver a sustainably effective strategy for prevention of
> T2D in Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands." ---

Work Package 1 is focused on both the general management of the DP-Next
project as well as on ensuring that the research follows
open and reproducible practices. My role in this work package is on the
second part. While I have a variety of tasks to complete, many of them
have a direct overlap with what we do in the Seedcase Project or can
make heavy use of the expertise we've been developing in Seedcase.

So, because of this, we in Seedcase will be collaborating with the
DP-Next project! This is a very exciting opportunity for us as it will
be our first collaboration, and the first time we'll be using our tools
and training to enable and support a larger, multi-center project.

We have many things still to discuss about our involvement, but the tasks
we will very likely be contributing with are:

-   Setting up and building the data infrastructure
-   Designing the data structure and pipeline
-   Processing and structuring data after collection
-   Training DP-Next members on more technical tools and practices, such
    as in using Git and GitHub

The DP-Next project doesn't officially start until September 2025, so we
still have some planning and discussing to do before settling on our
tasks and involvement. We're also super excited to be working on a
project that is spread across all of Denmark and to the Faroe Islands
and Greenland, which will give us the opportunity to spread awareness of
many of the practices Seedcase aims to promote and develop.

We'll post regular updates and lessons learned as we begin our
collaboration later in the year! :tada:
