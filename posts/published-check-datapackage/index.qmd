On November 27th, 2025, we published our second Python package to
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/check-datapackage). This package forms
the basis for ensuring that any metadata we create or edit for a [Data
Package](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-frictionless-data/)
is correct and compliant with the [Data Package
standard](https://datapackage.org). And since we are and will be working
with and managing many Data Packages over the coming years, this is an
important tool for us to have!

## What's `check-datapackage`?

As with all our packages and software tools, we have a dedicated website
for
[`check-datapackage`](https://check-datapackage.seedcase-project.org).
So, rather than repeat what is already in that website, this post gives
a very quick overview of what it is and why you might want to use it. It
can be summarised by its tagline:

> Ensure the compliance of your Data Package metadata

The "only" thing it does is checks the content of a `datapackage.json`
file against the standard. Nothing fancy. But we designed it to be
configurable, so that if you have specific needs for your Data Package,
you can adjust the checks accordingly. For example, if you want to
ensure that certain fields are always present in the metadata, you can
set up the checks to enforce that.

For now, `check-datapackage` is only a few Python functions and classes
that you can use within your own Python scripts. But in the future, we
plan to develop a command-line interface (CLI) so that you can use it
directly from your terminal without needing to write any code. Along
with including a config file, we hope to incorporate `check-datapackage`
into typical build tools or automated check workflows.

## Why use it?

We wanted this package to be incredibly simple and focused in its scope.
If you install or use it, you know exactly what it does. It also doesn't
include extra dependencies or features that you might not need. We
wanted it lightweight and easy to use.

While there are a few tools that provide some type of checks of Data
Packages, such as the
[frictionless-py](https://pypi.org/project/frictionless/) package, we
didn't want all the extras that came with these packages. Nor are these
tools easy to configure for our needs. In this regard, there were no
tools available that fit ours needs. So we built our own package that
does exactly what we need. And hopefully it might be useful for you too!

Eventually, when we develop `check-datapackage` as a CLI, you could
include it as a [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) or part of
your [continuous
integration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration)
workflow so that every time you make changes to your Data Package
metadata, it is automatically checked for compliance. That way, you will
always know that everything is good with your Data Package metadata. At
least, good according to the standard and your specific needs!

### Example use

We have a detailed
[guide](https://check-datapackage.seedcase-project.org/docs/guide/) on
how to use `check-datapackage`. But I'll briefly show how you might use
`check-datapackage`. The main function you would use is `check()`, which
takes as input the properties of a Data Package (i.e., the contents of
the `datapackage.json` file) as a Python dictionary.

``` python
import check_datapackage as cdp

# Normally you'd read in the `datapackage.json` file, but we'll
# show the actual contents here as a Python dict.
properties = {
    "name": "woolly-dormice",
    "id": "123-abc-123",
    "resources": [{
        "name": "woolly-dormice-2015",
        "path": "data.csv",
        "schema": {"fields": [{
            "name": "eye-colour",
            "type": "string",
        }]},
    }],
}

cdp.check(properties)
```

At a minimum, a Data Package needs to have a `resources` property. So in
this case, there are no issues with the Data Package. But if you were to
remove the `resources` property, which is required, and run the check
again, there would be an issue:

``` python
del properties["resources"]
cdp.check(properties)
```

If you want these checks to be treated as an error, you set the
parameter `error` to `True`:

``` python
cdp.check(properties, error=True)
```

If you wanted to exclude certain checks, you can do that by using the
`Config` and `Exclusion` classes. For example, if you wanted to ignore
all required checks, you could do:

``` python
exclusion_required = cdp.Exclusion(type="required")
config = cdp.Config(exclusions=[exclusion_required])
cdp.check(properties=package_properties, config=config)
```

If you wanted the issues listed in a more human-friendly way, we have
the `explain()` function that takes the list of issues returned by
`check()` and formats them nicely:

``` python
issues = cdp.check(properties)
cdp.explain(issues)
```

There's many other things you can configure in `check-datapackage`, so
