::: callout-note
We need to submit annual reports to Novo Nordisk Foundation as part of
our grant agreement. Since I need to write something anyway, I might as
well make it public and share it with anyone interested in our work over
the years. It's also a good way to reflect on what we've done and any
challenges, some expectations for the upcoming year, and what we've
learned. Plus, it's easier to find when I have to make further reports
over the years.

## Major activities

This last year was an incredibly productive year for us in terms of
tangible outputs. It felt like all our work building up the foundations
in 2024 paid off in 2025 as we officially published two Python packages,
three template tools, one R package, and developed a new workshop that
we ran twice! Plus, we presented our work for the first time at a
seminar and we hired another consultant to work with us on building
software and creating teaching materials.

The two projects we're collaborating with also started up in 2025, which
lead to more collaborative activities. In particular, our initial work
with them has been to help them set up their general digital
infrastructure, their websites, and their data management plans.

Overall, 2025 was a very good year for us :tada:

### Developed and ran a new workshop :open_book:

In early 2025, we received several requests to run a workshop on GitHub,
since we use it almost exclusively in our work. So, we developed a
workshop that introduces researchers to GitHub and how to use it for
their projects. The workshop is a *very* gentle [introduction to
GitHub](https://github-intro.rostools.org). In the end of May, we ran
the workshop for the first time and in-person for staff, researchers,
and doctors working at [Steno Diabetes Center
Aarhus](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/). We had 24 participants attend the
workshop. Then, we ran it again, this time virtually, for 11 PhD
students and researchers who are or will be working on the
[DP-Next](https://dp-next.github.io/) project (whom we collaborate with)
in September. We received great feedback from both workshops, which I
wrote a
[post](https://community.seedcase-project.org/posts/workshop-github-intro/)
about that also includes some figures of the feedback we received.

### Published Sprout! :package:

In July we officially published our first Python package,
[Sprout](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/). Sprout is a package that
helps create and manage a standardised and organised structure for
storing and describing research data as a Data Package. I wrote a
[post](https://community.seedcase-project.org/posts/published-sprout/)
about it that goes into more detail.

### Published a template for Data Packages :card_file_box:

Since we'll be creating and developing many Data Packages for our
collaborators, we decided to create a template tool to make it easier to
create new Data Packages that follow the Seedcase structure. We also
needed some way to keep these future Data Packages consistent with our
current practices, and we do that by continually updating the template
and synching it with the Data Packages created from it. So in the end of
July we published our first template tool, [Template Data
Package](https://template-data-package.seedcase-project.org/). We
published it so that others can use it to create a Data Package as well.
I've written a
[post](https://community.seedcase-project.org/posts/publish-template-data-package/)
about it.

### Published a template for websites :link:

Across the Seedcase Project, we have nearly 11 different websites.
Combined with the websites of our collaborators, which we also help
build and maintain (e.g., the GitHub organisations
[`onlimit-study`](https://github.com/onlimit-study/),
[`dp-next`](https://github.com/dp-next), and
[`steno-aarhus`](https://github.com/steno-aarhus), we have a lot of
websites to manage and track. So, to make it easier to create new
websites and to keep existing websites consistent with our current
practices, we created [Template
Website](https://template-website.seedcase-project.org/), which we
published in August. See my
[post](https://community.seedcase-project.org/posts/publish-template-website/)
for more details.

### Published a template for Python packages :toolbox:

While we had only created and developed one Python package at this
point, we knew we would be creating many more in the near future. As
with the Data Packages and websites, we created and published [Template
Python Package](https://template-python-package.seedcase-project.org/)
in September to make this whole process easier for us. See my
[post](https://community.seedcase-project.org/posts/publish-template-python-package/)
for more details.

### New team member! :busts_in_silhouette:

We hired a new consultant, [Joel Ostblom](https://joelostblom.com/), in
October to work with us on developing our software and in creating
teaching materials. He has extensive expertise from working as a
professor at the University of British Columbia in Canada building and
running data science courses, as well as being an active contributor to
the open source packages [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) and
[vega](https://github.com/vega). He started working with us to
contribute his expertise as we expand the number of software packages we
build and as we shift to developing training materials for workshops.
We're excited to have him on board!

### Published `check-datapackage`! :white_check_mark:

We initially had planned four packages related to developing and
managing Data Packages. However, in the process of building Sprout, we
needed some way of checking that a Data Package complied with the Data
Package standard. Since there were no similar packages available that
did those checks, at least none that fit our needs, we decided to take a
small detour to create and publish a Python package that fit our needs.
We also knew that others might find a package like this useful, so this
detour was as much for our needs as for others. So in the end of
November we published
[`check-datapackage`](https://check-datapackage.seedcase-project.org/),
which ensures that a Data Package is compliant with the standard. See
the
[post](https://community.seedcase-project.org/posts/published-check-datapackage/)
I wrote about this.

### Published `osdc` R package! :abacus:

Since 2023, we've been collaborating with [Anders Aasted
Isaksen](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/kontakt/anders-aasted-isaksen/) on
converting his register-based diabetes classification algorithm into an
R package so that others across Denmark can also use it. The package is
used to classify diabetes status using the Danish registers. And
finally, after a lot of work and many iterations, we officially
published the Open Source Diabetes Classifier,
[`osdc`](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/osdc/), R package in December
:tada: I wrote a
[post](https://community.seedcase-project.org/posts/published-osdc/)
that has more details on this.

### Collaborating projects officially started!

The two projects we are collaborating with,
[DP-Next](https://dp-next.github.io/) and
[ON-LiMiT](https://onlimit.org), officially started in 2025. While both
had officially started in some way in late 2024, our actual
collaboration with them began in September. And since then, we've been
working with them to build up their websites, set up (some of) their
digital infrastructures like with GitHub and
[GenomeDK](https://genome.au.dk/), provide some formal and informal
training, like the Introduction to GitHub workshop, and help with their
data collection, processing, and management plans.

## Challenges faced

We haven't had any major challenges to deal with in 2025. The biggest
"friction" points were mainly around coordinating and prioritizing work
between our own internal projects and the work we do for our
collaborators.

### Managing more projects and being firm in prioritisation

As we officially started our collaborations with DP-Next and ON-LiMiT,
there were a lot more projects and tasks to keep track of and manage. At
least my time spent in planning and organizing our work increased quite
a bit in 2025. We've had to be firmer with how we prioritise work and
keeping our focus on the most important tasks at any given time.

This increase in projects and tasks has also caused us to go from
working as a single team within the Seedcase Project to now being a
group made up of several sub-teams working on different projects. This
required us to change how we managed, communicated, and tracked tasks
and work, which was a bit of a source of friction and trial-and-error
until we found some processes and workflows that worked for us. We're
still refining these workflows and expect that we'll keep developing and
revising them the forthcoming year.

## Summary

2025 was a great year for us in the Seedcase Project with many tangible
outputs! And we're excited about what 2026 will bring, especially as our
collaborating projects start collecting data and we can start helping
them more with data processing and organising, and in developing the
remaining planned Seedcase Python packages. What's the next steps for
us? Check out our [high-level
roadmap](https://seedcase-project.org/roadmap/) as well as our [more
detailed project
roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/seedcase-project/projects/22/views/1)
(which changes more often than the high-level one).
