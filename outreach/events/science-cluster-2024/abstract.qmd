Across much of science, we suffer from a lack of software and data
engineering resources, skills, and research-specific tools. This has
negative impacts on our abilities to generate reliable results and be
productive and effective as researchers. Historically, there has been no
or limited sources of funding that allow allocating enough resources for
personnel with these technical skills. This is especially an issue for
small- to mid-sized clinical and health research groups. Part of the
issue is a lack of a general awareness by researchers, funding agencies,
and organizations on the importance of software and data engineering in
research, as well as the lack of systemic incentive structures to
dedicate resources and time to these practices. This has led to an
overall low capacity for these skills within research settings. The
consequence of which is the many organizational and technical challenges
with managing, sharing, building, and using research data, not least of
which is the impact on our ability to follow FAIR and open science
practices.

The aim of the Seedcase Project (\<seedcase-project.org\>) is two-fold:
To develop software to build and manage infrastructures for data
designed by researchers, for researchers; and, to create training
material to upskill researchers in modern software and data engineering
practices to more effectively tackle the challenges we currently face
and will continue to face in the future. Ultimately, we work towards
helping researchers do "better science in less time", not only those in
academic settings in Denmark but in industry and across the globe.

Our software- and training-based project aims at improving FAIR and open
scientific practices for health data. This Symposium is wonderful
opportunity to learn what others are doing in this space, network with
likeminded people, and share our work.
