This is the transcript of the flashtalk presented at the [Open Science
in Health Research: From Principles to Practice
Seminar](https://health.medarbejdere.au.dk/en/display/artikel/open-science-aabner-muligheder),
in June 2025.

The brief:

-   You will have 3 minutes to present your project/resource
-   Highlight how open science principles shaped this work
:::

Hi, I'm Signe, a software engineer at Aarhus University and Steno
Diabetes Center Aarhus. I'm here to tell you about a project I work on
called Seedcase.

## So, what is Seedcase?

Seedcase is a data infrastructure initiative focused on building open,
scalable tools for working with research data. From the start, our work
has been grounded in open science principles. Everything we build is
open source and developed in the open on GitHub under our GitHub
organisation. We also rely on other open source tools for our work, and
we actively document not just our software, but our processes, values,
and design decisions, following a documentation-driven development
approach. This documentation is published openly as websites for anyone
to explore, reuse, and contribute to.

## What are we actually building?

The core of Seedcase is a set of Python packages. We want to simplify
the process of going from messy raw data to structured and documented
Data Packages and make it findable via a website. **Data Package** is a
format we've adopted from the Frictionless Data Package Standard that's
designed to make data FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable.

So, our first package, **Sprout**, which will soon be published to PyPI,
helps you create Data Packages by simplifying the process of structuring
and checking your tabular data and metadata according to the Data
Package standard.

We've also planned:

-   A metadata checker, **check-datapackage**, which ensures your data
    and metadata are consistent and complete. We plan to release this as
    a standalone package to support any project using the Data Package
    standard, to promote reuse beyond our own tooling.

-   A template project, **template-data-package**, to help new users
    getting started with building their Data Package. This includes the
    recommended structure and dependencies of Data Packages following
    the approach built by Sprout.

-   Now that we have a structured Data Package, we also want to make it
    findable. For this, we’ll create a metadata website generator,
    **Flower**, which lets researchers turn metadata into a simple,
    shareable website. This makes it easier for others to discover and
    understand your dataset, without the need to download anything.

## What's next?

This fall, we'll be collaborating with two large research projects at
Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus to test and apply our tools in real-world
settings. These partnerships will be a key milestone by seeing our open
infrastructure used to help researchers structure their data more
transparently.

Lastly, while I'm presenting today, Seedcase is a team effort. We're two
software engineers, a database administrator, and a team lead---all are
committed to building open tools for open science.

Thanks for listening! And feel free to check us out or contribute on
GitHub!
