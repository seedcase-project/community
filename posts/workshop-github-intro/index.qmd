Early in 2025 we received several requests at Steno Aarhus from
colleagues and collaborators to run a workshop on how to use GitHub for
managing and working with files. Steno Aarhus has been making increasing
efforts to integrate use of GitHub into the organisation overall and
into individual research projects. But many researchers and staff are
still unfamiliar with how to use GitHub effectively. So in early 2025,
we started developing a [gentle introductory workshop to using
GitHub](https://github-intro.rostools.org).

We finished developing the material and ran the workshop on May 26th,
2025 in-person at Steno Aarhus for staff and researchers. We had 24
participants attend the workshop, which were more people than we
anticipated! The workshop was very well received, with very positive
feedback from participants (see below for some plots of the feedback).

We are collaborating with the [DP-Next
project](https://dp-next.github.io/) to develop and build up their data
infrastructure, collection processes, and storage capacity. But we're
also aiming to build up the technical expertise of people in the group.
So when DP-Next officially started in September 2025, we planned to run
the workshop for their members as well.

Since they are spread across all the Steno centers in Denmark, Faroe
Islands, and Greenland, we ran the workshop online. This was the first
time we've ever ran a workshop online, so we had to investigate
different options and ways for doing this effectively. We ended up using
[Gather](https://gather.town/) to virtually host the workshop.

On September 9th, 2025, we ran the workshop online for the DP-Next
members. We had 11 participants, who were a mix of PhD students and
postdocs from each of the Steno centers. As with the in-person workshop,
participants gave very positive feedback and they also enjoyed the
online platform.

## Participant demographics

The figure below shows some basic demographics about the participants of
the two workshops. The first workshop most participants used she/her
pronouns with diverse formal positions. In the second workshop, the
pronoun distribution of she/her and he/him were more even with almost
half of the participants being PhD students. No participants preferred
other pronouns to she/her and he/him.

## Quantitative feedback

While we collect anonymous [qualitative
feedback](https://github.com/rostools/samwise/tree/main/inst/extdata/surveys/gh_intro)
via free-form text in the surveys from participants after each workshop,
we also collect quantitative feedback. We have a series of statements
that participants respond to on a Likert-scale, from "Strongly disagree"
to "Strongly agree". The two plots below show the quantitative feedback
from participants of both the in-person and online workshops. Overall,
the feedback was very positive, with the vast majority of participants
agreeing or strongly agreeing with the statements provided.

## Next steps

We will probably run this workshop again next year, but we also want to
develop and run a workshop on how to collaborate effectively as a team
using GitHub, which we've [already
started](https://github.com/rostools/git4cats) working on. We're quite
excited about that one as we think a lot of people could benefit from
learning more effective practices at collaborating and developing
something together. We hope to run that workshop in mid-2026 :tada:
