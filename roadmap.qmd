title: Roadmap
---

{{< include /includes/_wip.qmd >}}

While the core deliverable of Seedcase is the software product described
in the [Design Docs website](https://design.seedcase-project.org)
documentation, there are several deliverables that form this core
product.

Because of the evolving nature of developing software, the software
product is never "completed" as it continues to be improved on and
updated. So here we define a **deliverable** for software as the first
minimum viable product (or prototype). After the first release of a
minimum viable product, the software product will continue to be tested
and refined based on user feedback, identified bugs, and additional
features.

Likewise, our documentation and training/education projects will also
continue to be refined and updated. So we define a deliverable as the
first time they are uploaded to an archive (like a software release) to
create a DOI (digital object identifier).

that's organized as a GitHub Project Board.

::: callout-important
Estimating the timeline, especially for software projects, is extremely difficult, as
it is dependent on multiple factors that often can't be predicted or anticipated. For instance, for software products,
we could encounter difficult bugs in the code or in revising the
implementation based on changing technical needs and resources. For documentation projects, at least the ones that we will be and are working on in the Seedcase Project,
they often frequently evolve as we learn, apply, test, and refine how we work and what we do.
For these reasons, and from our experiences on timelines regularly needing to be updated, we avoid giving specific timelines in this document. Regular updates to the estimated timeline of *some* of our projects are found in the
[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/seedcase-project/projects/22/views/1).

### Technical documentation

Following the [di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) method to structuring
documentation, by splitting them into four documentation types: learning
(tutorials or courses), goals (how-to guides), information (reference manuals),
and understanding (explanations, opinions, and maybe outreach).

A deliverable in these cases would be:

- Learning:
    - First time course is run with a group of learners.
    - First upload to an archive like Zenodo and has a DOI generated.
- Goals:
    - If the guide is connected to a software product, it would be the first time the guide is executable and uploaded to a software archive (e.g. PyPI).
    - If the guide is not connected to a software product, it would be the first time the guide is uploaded to an archive and has a DOI generated.

## Ongoing activities

Throughout the entire lifespan of this project, we will be assessing,
reviewing, updating, and adding to these activities:

-   Security
-   General documentation
-   Refining the design, API, and user interface
-   Testing and quality control of the code

Once we have a minimum viable product for any of the software
deliverables, we aim to test and deploy them in real-world projects. We
have several potential projects lined up for this:

-   [ADDITION](https://addition.au.dk/)
- [DP-Next](https://dp-next.github.io/)
-   [Health in Central
    Region](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/tvarsektoriel-forskning/helbred-i-midt/)
-   [DARTER](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/darter-project/)
    (register-based research project at Steno)
-   [DD2](https://dd2.dk/)

We also have several projects that act as infrastructural support for
the Seedcase Project, all of which are continually developed and are not
designed to be deliverables:

-   [`seedcase-project/.github`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/.github):
    Repository for the default community health files and development
    configuration files for the Seedcase Project GitHub organisation.
-   [`seedcase-project/data`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/data):
    Repository to store data we use for testing and demo purposes. All
    data is either fake, synthetically generated, or completely open.
