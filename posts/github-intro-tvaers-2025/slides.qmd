Aim: *Brief* introduction to GitHub and how it can be useful for
projects within SDCA

Questions: This is a new topic for many and there *can* be some
GitHub-related lingo. I will try to explain everything as we go along,
but if you have questions, don't hesitate to ask.

::: notes
-   Website: At its core, it's a website. If you open up your browser
    and type in "GitHub.com", you will be taken to GitHub
-   Stores files: GitHub is a place where you can store and share files
    related to a project, like a website, in a "repository" (meaning "storage" or "place to keep things", in Danish: "opbevare"). 
    - A repository is like a folder on your computer, but instead of being on your
    computer, it's on the internet. You can access it from anywhere with
    an internet connection.
-   Central to GitHub is that it uses a version control system called
    "Git"
    -   In Danish: "versionsstyring"
    -   Git: Track changes to files and folders over time (who made the
        changes, when + a message describing the changes)
    -   The name "GitHub": A "hub" (central place) for storing and
        sharing files, using Git to track changes
:::

## What can GitHub be used for?

-   Storing and sharing files (while tracking changes)
-   Creating websites
-   Collaboration
    -   Reviews: Giving and receiving feedback
    -   Communication (tasks, to-do lists, discussions)
    -   Project management (project boards)

::: notes
-   Store/share files like documents, images, code for your data
    analyses
:::

## Why use GitHub?

-   Everything related to your project in one place (files, tasks,
    discussions, feedback, project management)
-   Changes are tracked
-   Everything is open and accessible to everyone (unless you make it private)
-   Eases collaboration

::: notes
-   Everything in one place:
    -   Files stored in the same place as your tasks, discussions,
        feedback, and project management
    -   No need to email files around or having multiple versions of the same  file
-   Tracking changes: You can see who did what when + revert to previous
    versions of files if needed
-   Transparency: On GitHub, everything is open and accessible to
    everyone (unless you make it private). This means that anyone can
    see your work, and you can see other people's work.
