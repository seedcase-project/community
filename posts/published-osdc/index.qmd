title: "Published our first externally collaborated R package, osdc"
description: |
    Over the last two year, we've collaborated with a researcher at Steno Aarhus on building an
    R package called osdc. This package, titled
    *Open Source Diabetes Classifier*, classifies diabetes status in the
    Danish registers. And finally, we've published it to CRAN!

On December 10th, 2025, we finally published our first R package to
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)! :tada:

The package is called
[osdc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osdc/index.html), or
"Open Source Diabetes Classifier", and it is our first package that
we've built in collaboration with an external researcher, [Anders Aasted
Isaksen](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/kontakt/anders-aasted-isaksen/). He
developed an algorithm to classify type 1 and type 2 diabetes using
Danish registers as data sources, and we worked together to turn this
algorithm into an R package that others can use. We started the
collaboration back in 2023, and after a lot of work,
we finally got it to a stage that we could publish a first
version to CRAN.

The package has two aims (as described in the package
[documentation](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/osdc/)):

1.  To provide an open-source, code-based algorithm to classify type 1
    and type 2 diabetes using Danish registers as data sources. There
    are other diabetes algorithms developed in Denmark for the
    registers, but they are not open source nor packaged into a reusable
    format.
2.  To inspire discussions within the Danish register-based research
    space on the openness and ease of use on the existing tooling and
    registers, and on the need for an official process for updating or
    contributing to existing data sources.

## Who is it for and why use it?

The main reason for building the osdc package was to provide a tool
for researchers doing diabetes research with Danish register data to classify diabetes. There
are no Danish registers that fully captures the different ways that a
person could be classified with diabetes, as administrative diagnosis
data is not always complete nor accurate. So, researchers have had to
develop different algorithms to get a better idea of who has diabetes in
the Danish registers.

However, these algorithms have not been open source, and they have not
been packaged into reusable tools. Which has lead to many researchers
having different "in-house" solutions for their group or organisation that
other groups can't really use effectively. We wanted to change that.

So, we built the osdc package with all the necessary details for
researchers to classify diabetes status in their own Danish
register data. For example, the package provides a list of which registers and
variables are needed with the use of the `registers()` function. Other
than a few other helper functions, the main function of the package is
`classify_diabetes()`, which takes all the required registers and
outputs a data frame with a list of individuals, their diabetes status,
and the date when the classification was made.

Aside from those functions, the package provides an `algorithm()` function that lists all the
specific criteria used in the algorithm.
This makes it easier for others to assess how exactly the algorithm classifies
diabetes.

The next step is to start using the osdc package in collaborating projects that
use Denmark Statistics and register data :tada:
