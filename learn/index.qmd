## Learning shorts

Below is a list of learning shorts on things the Seedcase team has
learned and want to share both internally and externally. Read our

## Learnings and insights from books

Books are a fantastic source of advanced learning and inspiration. 
These insight documents are condensed summaries of the books with
take-home messages and insights that the author has found interesting
and useful. 
The main motivation for these documents
are:

1. The content of the book is interesting and useful enough to share with others, like the 
rest of the Seedcase team.
1. To consolidate the document author's learning and insights from the book.
1. To have as a resource and reference for future purposes.
