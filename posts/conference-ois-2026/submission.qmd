Submitting to track 1: Open and collaborative approaches along the
entire scientific research process, including opportunities, challenges,
and contingency factors. Possible topics include but are not limited to:

-   Open data/material sharing/re-use
-   Platforms facilitating open and collaborative approaches to
    scientific research
:::

Across much of science, we suffer from a lack of software and data
engineering resources, skills, and research-specific tools. This has
negative impacts on our abilities to generate reliable results and be
productive and effective as researchers. Part of the issue is a lack of
a general awareness by researchers, funding agencies, and organizations
on the importance of software and data engineering in research, as well
as a lack of systemic incentive structures to dedicate resources and
time to these software and data practices. A major consequence is that
we face many organizational and technical challenges with managing,
sharing, building, and using research data, not least of which is it
impairs our ability to follow FAIR and open science practices.

Through the Seedcase Project (\<seedcase-project.org\>), we aim to
resolve some of these issues. We are currently building a framework to
make building and managing FAIR research data that is easier, modern,
organized, and robust. We plan to achieve this by developing a series of
loosely coupled tools that work together within a specific framework.
The tools we've published are:

-   Sprout (\<sprout.seedcase-project.org\>): A Python package that is
    designed to help create and manage a standardised and organised
    structure for storing and describing research data. Using modern
    data engineering and management practices, Sprout helps to ensure
    and enforce that research data are well-designed, discoverable,
    well-documented, and ultimately more (re)usable for later analyses.
    This package is built around the Data Package standard
    (\<datapackage.org\>).
-   `check-datapackages` (\<check-datapackages.seedcase-project.org\>):
    A Python package that checks your Data Package's metadata against
    the Data Package standard, to ensure that your metadata is compliant
    with the standard.
-   Template Data Package
    (\<template-data-package.seedcase-project.org\>): This is a template
    for creating a new Data Package following the Seedcase structure.
    Use this template to quickly get started with a new Data Package
    with all the necessary files and configurations in place, including
    for developing the Data Package.

The tools we are actively developing or will develop in the near future
include:

-   Flower (\<flower.seedcase-project.org\>): A Python package and
    command-line tool to generate and display your `datapackage.json`
    file in a human-friendly way. This is early in development.
-   Propagate: A planned tool to make it easier to submit and process
    reproducible requests for a subset of data from a larger Data
    Package through a machine-readable set of instructions.
-   Garden: A planned tool to manage and track research projects using a
    Data Package

Not only do we publish these data engineering tools, we also publish our
internal developer tools and documentation. Our roadmap at
\<seedcase-project.org/roadmap/\> lists all of our external and internal
products and their development status.

Ultimately, we work towards helping researchers do "better science in
less time", not only those in academic settings in Denmark but also in
industry and across the globe.

This project is funded by a Novo Nordisk Foundation grant (number
NNF21OC0069462).
