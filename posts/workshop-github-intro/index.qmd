Early in 2025 we received several requests at Steno Aarhus to run a
workshop on how to use GitHub for managing and working with files. Steno
Aarhus has been making increasing efforts to integrate use of GitHub
into the organisation overall and into individual research projects. But
many researchers and staff were still unfamiliar with how to use GitHub
effectively. So in early 2025, we started developing a [gentle
introduction workshop to using
GitHub](https://github-intro.rostools.org).

We finished developing the material and ran the workshop on May 26th,
2025 in-person at Steno Aarhus for staff and researchers. We had 24
participants register and attend the workshop, which we didn't expect to
be so high! The workshop was very well received, with very positive
feedback from participants (see below for some plots of the feedback).

We are collaborating with the [DP-Next
project](https://dp-next.github.io/) to develop and build up their data
infrastructure, collection processes, and storage capacity. But we're
also aiming to build up the technical expertise of their members. So
when DP-Next officially started in September 2025, we planned to run the
workshop for their members as well.

Since they are spread across all the Steno centers in Denmark, Faroe
Islands, and Greenland, we had to run the workshop online. However this
was the first time we've ever ran a workshop online, so we had to
investigate different options and ways for doing this effectively. We
ended up using [Gather](https://gather.town/) to virtually host the
workshop.

So on September 9th, 2025, we ran the workshop online for DP-Next
members. We had 11 participants, who were a mix of PhD students and
postdocs from each of the Steno centers. As with the in-person workshop,
participants gave very positive feedback and especially enjoyed the
online platform.

## Participant demographics

To give some "harder" numbers, the figure below shows some basic
demographics about the participants of the two workshops. The first
workshop had a large majority of participants who identified as
"she/her" as well as different types of positions.

## Quantitative feedback

While we collect anonymous [qualitative
feedback](https://github.com/rostools/samwise/tree/main/inst/extdata/surveys/gh_intro)
from participants after each workshop from a short survey, we also
collect quantitative feedback. We have a series of statements that
participants respond to on a Likert-scale, from "Strongly disagree" to
"Strongly agree". The two plots below show the quantitative feedback
from participants of both the in-person and online workshops. Overall,
the feedback was very positive, with the vast majority of participants
agreeing or strongly agreeing with the statements provided.

## Next steps

We will probably run this workshop again next year, but we also want to
develop and run a workshop on how to collaborate effectively as a team
using GitHub, which we've [already
started](https://github.com/rostools/git4cats) working on. We're quite
excited about that one as we think a lot of people could benefit from
learning more effective practices at collaborating and developing
something together. We hope to run that workshop in mid-2026 :tada:
