For our in-person sessions, we're going to discuss the Denmark
Statistics project database at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, how we'll
use it in our collaborating project
[DP-Next](https://dp-next.github.io), and how we can align efforts at
converting the registers into Parquet format rather than in SAS format.

This post contains the [slides](slides.qmd) used in the session for
talking about Parquet.
