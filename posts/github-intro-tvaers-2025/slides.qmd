Aim: *Brief* introduction to GitHub and how it can be useful for
projects within SDCA

Questions: This is a new topic for many and there *can* be some
GitHub-related lingo. I will try to explain everything as we go along,
but if you have questions, don't hesitate to ask.

## Who am I?

-   The Seedcase Project
-   Develop teaching material and teach workshops
-   R-package: Open-Source Diabetes Classifier
-   Admin for `steno-aarhus` on GitHub

. . .

I spend 95 % of my work time using GitHub :raised_hands:

::: notes
-   Seedcase Project: open source software (Python packages) for
    packaging and documenting research data

::: notes
-   Website: At its core, it's a website. If you open up your browser
    and type in "GitHub.com", you will be taken to GitHub
-   Stores files: GitHub is a place where you can store and share files
    related to a project, like the website. Each project can be thought
    of as a folder on your computer, but instead of being on your
    computer, it's on the internet. You can access it from anywhere with
    an internet connection.
-   Central to GitHub is that it uses a version control system called
    "Git"
    -   In Danish: "versionsstyring"
    -   Git: Track changes to files and folders over time (who made the
        changes, when + a message describing the changes)
    -   The name "GitHub": A "hub" (central place) for storing and
        sharing files related to a project, using Git to track changes
:::

## What can GitHub be used for?

-   Storing and sharing files
-   Creating websites
-   Collaboration
    -   Communication (to-do lists, discussions)
    -   Reviews: Giving and receiving feedback
    -   Project management

::: notes
-   Store/share files like documents, images, code for your data
    analyses
:::

## Why use GitHub?

-   Everything related to your project in one place
-   Changes are tracked
-   Transparency and openness

::: notes
-   Everything in one place:
    -   No need to email files around or having multiple versions of the
        same file
    -   Eases collaboration bc you work on a single file/folder in a
        single central location
-   Tracking changes: You can see who did what when + revert to previous
    versions of files if needed
-   Transparency: On GitHub, everything is open and accessible to
    everyone (unless you make it private). This means that anyone can
    see your work, and you can see other people's work.

I think this is where I need some help. The *motivation*, the *why is
this important to researchers*
