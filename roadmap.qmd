title: Roadmap

{{< include /includes/_wip.qmd >}}

While the core deliverable of Seedcase is the software product described
in the [Design Docs website](https://design.seedcase-project.org)
documentation, there are several deliverables that form this core
product.

Because of the evolving nature of developing software, the software
product is never "completed" as it continues to be improved on and
updated. So here we define a **deliverable** for software as the first
minimum viable product (or prototype). After the first release of a
minimum viable product, the software product will continue to be
tested and refined based on user feedback, identified bugs, and additional
features.

Likewise, our documentation and training/education projects will also continue to be refined and
updated. So we define a deliverable as the first time they are uploaded to
an archive (like a software release) to create a DOI (digital object
identifier).

### Software

Estimating the timeline for software development is very difficult, as
it is dependent on multiple factors that often can't be predicted, such
as encountering difficult bugs in the code or in revising the
implementation based on changing technical needs and resources. The
timeline below is an approximation and may change as the project
progresses.

| Status                     | Timeline               | Deliverable                                                                               | Description                                                                                        |

### Documentation

While we want the software products to have a more tangible deliverable
and timeline, we will be continually updating and refining related 
documentation. At some regular intervals, we plan on uploading the documents
to an archive for generating DOIs and for greater dissemination.

## Ongoing activities

Throughout the entire lifespan of this project, we will be assessing,
reviewing, updating, and adding to these activities:

-   Security
-   General documentation
-   Refining the user interface
-   Testing and re-testing of the code

Once we have a minimum viable product for any of the software
deliverables, we aim to test and deploy them in real-world projects. We
have several projects lined up for this:

-   [DD2](https://dd2.dk/)
-   [ADDITION](https://addition.au.dk/)
-   [Health in Central Region](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/tvarsektoriel-forskning/helbred-i-midt/)
-   [DARTER](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/darter-project/) (register-based research project at Steno)

We also have several projects that act as infrastructural support for
the Seedcase Project, all of which are continually developed and are not
designed to be deliverables:

-   [`seedcase-project/.github`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/.github):
    Repository for the default community health files and development
    configuration files for the Seedcase Project GitHub organisation.
-   [`seedcase-project/data`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/data):
    Repository to store data we use for testing and demo purposes. All
    data is either fake, synthetically generated, or completely open.
-   [`seedcase-project/seedcase-theme`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-theme):
    Quarto extension with Seedcase-specific CSS themes and HTML
    templates for all Seedcase websites.
